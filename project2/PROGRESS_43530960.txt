21 May 2016 "Motor command working at base level." Commit #:  91c96ec31792b665acdd5d276c1d20cac46c8aaf

Progress Shown
Implemented functionality of get passkey and crude communication with rover to give motor commands was also achieved at this point. Rover Task was made to handle communications to be sent to and recieved by the rover through the radio task via a queue.



29 May 2016 "Task 3.1 functioning, rfchan fixed, bunch of cli functions added" Commit #: 3757be09570322d8bfd2d185b517a0e0a9348ad1

Progress Shown
Have Implemented Task 3 at this point by implementing a calibration where by the top and bottom corner of the sand pit can be set in orb values and the top and bottom corner of the display grid can be set in the same way for pan and tilt values. Fixed the crude rfchanset function and have started to go back and . Calibration is still not quite ready as it is set up for multiple speeds which makes it harder to calibrate left and right wheel speeds to follow a straight line as the relationships between speeds is not linear and therefore calibrating at one speed means that for other speeds, the rover doesn't travel straight. Implemented an additional FSM for the radio task to either recieve from ORB or communicate with a rover (Transmit and Recieve) or recieve packets for a rover (Recieve only);
